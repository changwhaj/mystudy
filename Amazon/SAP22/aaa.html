The four EBS volumes are set in RAID 0, and each Provided IOPS volume is provisioned with 4,000 IOPS (4,000 16KB reads or writes), giving the instance a total of 16,000 random IOPS. The EC2 instance initially performs at the desired rate of 16,000 IOPS random read and write. Later on, to boost the instance's overall random I/O performance, you add two 500 GB EBS Provisioned IOPS volumes to the RAID. Each volume, like the original four, is provisioned to 4,000 IOPS, for a total of 24,000 IOPS on the EC2 instance. Monitoring indicates that the CPU usage of the EC2 instance went from 50% to 70%, while the total random IOPS observed at the instance level remained constant.  \n",

    "A cellular service provider need a solution for storing and analyzing log files containing user activity. At the moment, log files are transmitted daily to an Amazon Linux instance running on an Amazon EC2 cloud. Once a day, a batch script aggregates data for analysis by a third-party program. The third-party tool uses the data supplied to it to build a visualization for end users. The batch script is inconvenient to maintain, and delivering the ever-increasing data quantities to the third-party application takes several hours. The organization wants cost savings and is willing to accept a new tool that reduces development time and administrative expenditure. The organization wishes to develop a more agile system capable of storing and performing analysis in near-real time and with a minimum of overhead. The solution must be both cost efficient and scalable in order to accommodate the expansion of the company's end-user base.  \n",

Connect a business intelligence tool running on Amazon EC2 to Amazon Redshift and create the visualizations.  \n",
    "**B.** Use an Amazon Kinesis agent running on an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group to collect and send the data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. The Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream will deliver the data directly to Amazon ES. Use Kibana to visualize the data.  \n",
    "**C.** Use an in-memory caching application running on an Amazon EBS-optimized EC2 instance to capture the log data in near real-time. Install an Amazon ES cluster on the same EC2 instance to store the log files as they are delivered to Amazon EC2 in near real-time. Install a Kibana plugin to create the visualizations.  \n",

    "Users may bid on collectable objects on an auction website. According to the auction regulations, each bid must be processed only once and in the sequence in which it was received. The present approach is based on an Amazon EC2 web server fleet that writes bid records to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. A single t2.large instance is configured with a cron job that runs the bid processor, which receives and analyzes incoming bids from Kinesis Data Streams. Although the auction site is gaining popularity, users are reporting that certain bids are not being registered.  \n",

At the start of each bid processing run, scan Kinesis Data Streams for unprocessed records.  \n",

    "**D.** Switch the EC2 instance type from t2.large to a larger general compute instance type. Put the bid processor EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group that scales out the number of EC2 instances running the bid processor, based on the IncomingRecords metric in Kinesis Data Streams.  \n",

At the moment, a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) farm is running a desktop picture viewer and a desktop chat application. Both programs handle user accounts and sharing via the usage of a shared database. Users log in using a web portal, which runs apps and broadcasts the application's display to the user's workstation.

    "A corporation uses Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda to operate an ordering system, with each order received as a JSON message. The firm just held a marketing event that resulted in a tenfold rise in order volume. With this rise, the ordering system began to exhibit the following undesirable behaviors:  \n",
    "- Lambda errors during order processing result in queue backlogs.  \n",
    "- Multiple times, the same orders have been processed.  \n",
    "A Solutions Architect has been tasked with resolving current ordering system difficulties and including the following resilience features:  \n",
    "- Retain orders that are difficult for analysis.  \n",
    "- Notify you if the number of errors exceeds a predefined threshold.  \n",
    "\n",

    "Recently, a company expanded via acquisitions. Two of the acquired businesses have the same IP CIDR range. There is a new short-term need that AnyCompany A (VPC-A) be able to interact with a server in AnyCompany B that has the IP address 10.0.0.77. (VPC-B). Additionally, AnyCompany A must communicate with all of the resources in AnyCompany C. (VPC-C). The Network team has established the VPC peer connections, but is experiencing communication difficulties between VPC-A and VPC-B. The team feels that the routing tables in the VPCs are inaccurate after an analysis.  \n",

Further log examination indicated that a single order message in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue was triggering a backend problem and preventing further order messages from being processed.

    "On a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances, a business is implementing a distributed in-memory database. A central node and eight worker nodes comprise the fleet. The main node is responsible for monitoring the cluster's health, taking user requests, distributing them among worker nodes, and responding to the client with an aggregate answer. To duplicate data partitions, worker nodes interact with one another.  \n",
