A business operates a legacy system on a single Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon EBS storage that is m4.2xlarge. The web server and a self-managed Oracle database are both operated on the EC2 instance. Every 12 hours, a snapshot of the EBS volume is taken, and an AMI is built from the fully configured EC2 instance.  
A recent occurrence caused the EC2 instance to be terminated, resulting in many hours of outage. The application was successfully started from the AMI, however due to the age of the EBS snapshot and the database repair, 8 hours of data were lost. Additionally, the system remained down for four hours while the Systems Operators conducted these tasks manually.  

What architectural modifications will help limit downtime and the risk of data loss?  

>**A.** Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to automatically recover the instance. Create a script that will check and repair the database upon reboot. Subscribe the Operations team to the Amazon SNS message generated by the CloudWatch alarm.

A corporation generated accounts for each of its Development teams, totaling 200 accounts. Each account has a single virtual private cloud (VPC) in a single region, each of which has many microservices operating in Docker containers and requiring communication with microservices in other accounts. According to the Security team's needs, these microservices must not traverse the public internet, and only specific internal services should be permitted to contact other internal services. If any network traffic for a service is refused, the Security team must be alerted, including the originating IP.  

How can connection between services be developed while adhering to security requirements?  

>**A.** Create a VPC peering connection between the VPCs. Use security groups on the instances to allow traffic from the security group IDs that are permitted to call the microservice. Apply network ACLs and allow traffic from the local VPC and peered VPCs only. Within the task definition in Amazon ECS for each of the microservices, specify a log configuration by using the awslogs driver. Within Amazon CloudWatch Logs, create a metric filter and alarm off of the number of HTTP 403 responses. Create an alarm when the number of messages exceeds a threshold set by the Security team.  
**B.** Ensure that no CIDR ranges are overlapping, and attach a virtual private gateway (VGW) to each VPC. Provision an IPsec tunnel between each VGW and enable route propagation on the route table. Configure security groups on each service to allow the CIDR ranges of the VPCs in the other accounts. Enable VPC Flow Logs, and use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for rejected traffic. Create an IAM role and allow the Security team to call the AssumeRole action for each account.  
**C.** Deploy a transit VPC by using third-party marketplace VPN appliances running on Amazon EC2, dynamically routed VPN connections between the VPN appliance, and the virtual private gateways (VGWs) attached to each VPC within the region. Adjust network ACLs to allow traffic from the local VPC only. Apply security groups to the microservices to allow traffic from the VPN appliances only. Install the awslogs agent on each VPN appliance, and configure logs to forward to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the security account for the Security team to access.  
**D.** Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for each microservice. Attach the NLB to a PrivateLink endpoint service and whitelist the accounts that will be consuming this service. Create an interface endpoint in the consumer VPC and associate a security group that allows only the security group IDs of the services authorized to call the producer service. On the producer services, create security groups for each microservice and allow only the CIDR range of the allowed services. Create VPC Flow Logs on each VPC to capture rejected traffic that will be delivered to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription that streams the log data to a security account.

Remote users often complain about latency.  

How can this application be modified to be more scalable and to enable automated failover at the lowest possible cost?  

>**A.** Use Amazon Route 53 failover routing with geolocation-based routing. Host the website on automatically scaled Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer with an additional Application Load Balancer and EC2 instances for the application layer in each region. Use a Multi-AZ deployment with MySQL as the data layer.  
**B.** Use Amazon Route 53 round robin routing to distribute the load evenly to several regions with health checks. Host the website on automatically scaled Amazon ECS with AWS Fargate technology containers behind a Network Load Balancer, with an additional Network Load Balancer and Fargate containers for the application layer in each region. Use Amazon Aurora replicas for the data layer.  
**C.** Use Amazon Route 53 latency-based routing to route to the nearest region with health checks. Host the website in Amazon S3 in each region and use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda for the application layer. Use Amazon DynamoDB global tables as the data layer with Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) for caching.  
**D.** Use Amazon Route 53 geolocation-based routing. Host the website on automatically scaled AWS Fargate containers behind a Network Load Balancer with an additional Network Load Balancer and Fargate containers for the application layer in each region. Use Amazon Aurora Multi-Master for Aurora MySQL as the data layer.

A business is transferring a portion of its application APIs from Amazon EC2 instances to a serverless environment. For the new application, the business has used Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. The Lambda function's principal job is to get data from a third-party Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. The Lambda function is tied to the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the original EC2 instances for consistency.  
Test users report being unable to access the newly relocated feature, and the organization is getting API Gateway 5xx issues. The SaaS provider's monitoring records indicate that the queries never made it to its systems. The organization finds that the Lambda services are generating Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When the same functionality is tested on Amazon EC2 instances, it works correctly.  

What is the source of the problem?  

>**A.** Lambda is in a subnet that does not have a NAT gateway attached to it to connect to the SaaS provider.  
**B.** The end-user application is misconfigured to continue using the endpoint backed by EC2 instances.  
**C.** The throttle limit set on API Gateway is too low and the requests are not making their way through.

A business is distributing both static and dynamic content from a web application operating behind an Application Load Balancer through an Amazon CloudFront distribution. For dynamic content, the web application needs user authorisation and session monitoring. The CloudFront distribution is set with a single cache behavior that forwards the HTTP whitelist headers Authorization, Host, and User-Agent, as well as a session cookie, to the origin. All other cache behavior parameters are left alone.  
A valid ACM certificate is deployed to the CloudFront distribution through the distribution settings, along with a corresponding CNAME. Additionally, the ACM certificate is applied to the Application Load Balancer's HTTPS listener. CloudFront's origin protocol policy is configured to use exclusively HTTPS. According to the cache statistics report, this distribution has an extremely high miss rate.  

What can the Solutions Architect do to increase this distribution's cache hit rate without jeopardizing the SSL/TLS handshake between CloudFront and the Application Load Balancer?  

>**A.** Create two cache behaviors for static and dynamic content. Remove the User-Agent and Host HTTP headers from the whitelist headers section on both of the cache behaviors. Remove the session cookie from the whitelist cookies section and the Authorization HTTP header from the whitelist headers section for cache behavior configured for static content.  
**B.** Remove the User-Agent and Authorization HTTP headers from the whitelist headers section of the cache behavior. Then update the cache behavior to use presigned cookies for authorization.  
**C.** Remove the Host HTTP header from the whitelist headers section and remove the session cookie from the whitelist cookies section for the default cache behavior. Enable automatic object compression and use Lambda@Edge viewer request events for user authorization.  
**D.** Create two cache behaviors for static and dynamic content. Remove the User-Agent HTTP header from the whitelist headers section on both of the cache behaviors.

An company employs Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB to power a write-intensive mobile application. Although the application expanded satisfactorily, expenditures climbed dramatically as a result of higher-than-anticipated Lambda charges. The application's use is erratic, yet it has consistently increased by 20% month over month.  

The Solutions Architect observes that the average execution time for the present Lambda functions is 4.5 minutes. The majority of the delay time is due to a high-latency network call to an on-premises 3-TB MySQL database server. Because the VPC is accessed over a VPN, the Lambda functions have been set with a five-minute timeout.  

How can the Solutions Architect minimize the present architecture's cost?  

>**A.**  
- Substitute AWS Direct Connect for the VPN to minimize network latency to the on-premises MySQL database.  
- Local caching should be enabled in the mobile application to minimize Lambda function invocation calls.  
- Monitor the performance of the Lambda function; progressively reduce the timeout and memory characteristics while keeping an acceptable execution time.  
- Offload DynamoDB's commonly accessed records to Amazon ElastiCache.  

**B.**  
- Substitute AWS Direct Connect for the VPN to minimize network latency to the on-premises MySQL database.  
- Cache API Gateway response data in Amazon CloudFront.  
- Instead of Lambda, use Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances.  
- Enable Auto Scaling on Amazon EC2 and make advantage of Spot Instances during peak periods.  
- To control target consumption, enable DynamoDB Auto Scaling.  

**C.**  
- Migrate the MySQL database server to Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ.  
- Enable Amazon CloudFront caching of Amazon API Gateway responses to minimize the number of Lambda function invocations.  
- Monitor the performance of the Lambda function; progressively reduce the timeout and memory characteristics while keeping an acceptable execution time.  
- Enable DynamoDB Accelerator and DynamoDB Auto Scaling for frequently accessed records.  

**D.**  
- Migrate the MySQL database server to Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ.  
- Enable API caching on the API Gateway to minimize Lambda function calls.  
- Continue to monitor the performance of the AWS Lambda function; progressively reduce the timeout and memory attributes while keeping an acceptable execution time.

A business owns and operates a video processing platform. Users upload files using a web server, which then saves them on an Amazon EFS share. On a single Amazon EC2 instance, this web server is executing. A separate set of instances, each operating in its own Auto Scaling group, checks the EFS share directory structure for new files to process and creates new videos (thumbnails, various resolutions, compression, etc.) according to the instructions file that is uploaded with the video files. A separate application processes the video files and subsequently deletes them from the EFS share using a set of instances controlled by an Auto Scaling group. The output is saved to an S3 bucket. The buyer is provided links to the processed video files.  
The organization has observed that when additional instances of the Auto Scaling Group are added, many files are processed twice, resulting in no improvement in picture processing time. These video files have a maximum size of 2GB.  

What should the Solutions Architect do to increase video file dependability and minimize duplicate processing?  

>**A.** Modify the web application to upload the video files directly to Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger an AWS Lambda function every time a file is uploaded, and have this Lambda function put a message into an Amazon SQS queue. Modify the video processing application to read from SQS queue for new files and use the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group.  
**B.** Set up a cron job on the web server instance to synchronize the contents of the EFS share into Amazon S3. Trigger an AWS Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to process the video file and store the results in Amazon S3. Using Amazon CloudWatch Events, trigger an Amazon SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.  
**C.** Rewrite the web application to run directly from Amazon S3 and use Amazon API Gateway to upload the video files to an S3 bucket. Use an S3 trigger to run an AWS Lambda function each time a file is uploaded to process and store new video files in a different bucket. Using CloudWatch Events, trigger an SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.  
**D.** Rewrite the web application to run from Amazon S3 and upload the video files to an S3 bucket. Each time a new file is uploaded, trigger an AWS Lambda function to put a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the instructions. Modify the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Use the queue depth metric to adjust the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances.

A business uses Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Lambda services to power a serverless application. Currently, the application code is deployed by creating a new version number for the Lambda function and updating it using an AWS CLI script. If an error occurs with the new function version, another CLI script reverts to the prior functioning version of the function. The organization wishes to lower the time required to deploy new versions of the application logic given by Lambda functions, as well as the time required to discover and reverse problems.  

How is this possible?  

>**A.** Create and deploy nested AWS CloudFormation stacks with the parent stack consisting of the AWS CloudFront distribution and API Gateway, and the child stack containing the Lambda function. For changes to Lambda, create an AWS CloudFormation change set and deploy; if errors are triggered, revert the AWS CloudFormation change set to the previous version.

>**A.** Write a bash script that uses the AWS CLI to query the current state in one region and output a JSON representation. Pass the JSON representation to the AWS CLI, specifying the --region parameter to deploy the application to other regions.  
**B.** Write a bash script that uses the AWS CLI to query the current state in one region and output an AWS CloudFormation template. Create a CloudFormation stack from the template by using the AWS CLI, specifying the --region parameter to deploy the application to other regions.  
**C.** Write a CloudFormation template describing the application's infrastructure in the resources section. Create a CloudFormation stack from the template by using the AWS CLI, specify multiple regions using the --regions parameter to deploy the application.  
**D.** Write a CloudFormation template describing the application's infrastructure in the Resources section. Use a CloudFormation stack set from an administrator account to launch stack instances that deploy the application to other regions.

A news organization maintains a 30-terabyte collection of digital news footage. These movies are archived on tape in an on-premises tape library and accessed using a Media Asset Management (MAM) system. The business intends to use a MAM function to automatically improve the metadata for these movies and organize them into a searchable library. The firm must be able to search for things in the video based on their appearance, such as objects, environment elements, or people's faces. A catalog is provided that comprises the faces of those who appear in the films, along with a photograph of each individual. The firm want to move these movies to Amazon Web Services (AWS).  

The organization has a high-speed AWS Direct Connect connection and wishes to migrate video footage from its present file system to the MAM solution.  

How can these needs be accomplished with the LEAST amount of continuing management overhead and with the least amount of interruption to the current system as possible?  

>**A.** Set up an AWS Storage Gateway, file gateway appliance on-premises. Use the MAM solution to extract the videos from the current archive and push them into the file gateway. Use the catalog of faces to build a collection in Amazon Rekognition. Build an AWS Lambda function that invokes the Rekognition Javascript SDK to have Rekognition pull the video from the Amazon S3 files backing the file gateway, retrieve the required metadata, and push the metadata into the MAM solution.  
**B.** Set up an AWS Storage Gateway, tape gateway appliance on-premises. Use the MAM solution to extract the videos from the current archive and push them into the tape gateway. Use the catalog of faces to build a collection in Amazon Rekognition. Build an AWS Lambda function that invokes the Rekognition Javascript SDK to have Amazon Rekognition process the video in the tape gateway, retrieve the required metadata, and push the metadata into the MAM solution.  
**C.** Configure a video ingestion stream by using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. Use the catalog of faces to build a collection in Amazon Rekognition. Stream the videos from the MAM solution into Kinesis Video Streams. Configure Amazon Rekognition to process the streamed videos. Then, use a stream consumer to retrieve the required metadata, and push the metadata into the MAM solution. Configure the stream to store the videos in Amazon S3.  
**D.** Set up an Amazon EC2 instance that runs the OpenCV libraries. Copy the videos, images, and face catalog from the on-premises library into an Amazon EBS volume mounted on this EC2 instance. Process the videos to retrieve the required metadata, and push the metadata into the MAM solution, while also copying the video files to an Amazon S3 bucket.

A business is considering migrating multiple software testing lab settings. Each lab's test runs are managed using a variety of bespoke tools. The laboratories execute software tests on immutable infrastructure, and the findings are saved in a highly available SQL database cluster. While recreating the proprietary tools in its whole is beyond the scope of the migration project, the organization want to optimize workloads during the move.  

Which technique for application migration satisfies this requirement?  

>**A.** Re-host  
**B.** Re-platform  
**C.** Re-factor/re-architect  
**D.** Retire

A business is pursuing a multi-account approach, but the management team is concerned that services such as DNS may become too complicated. The organization requires a solution that enables the sharing of private DNS amongst virtual private clouds (VPCs) under distinct accounts. The firm will have a total of around 50 accounts.  

Which option would result in the LEAST complicated DNS architecture possible while ensuring that each VPC can resolve all AWS resources?  

>**A.** Create a shared services VPC in a central account, and create a VPC peering connection from the shared services VPC to each of the VPCs in the other accounts. Within Amazon Route 53, create a privately hosted zone in the shared services VPC and resource record sets for the domain and subdomains. Programmatically associate other VPCs with the hosted zone.  
**B.** Create a VPC peering connection among the VPCs in all accounts. Set the VPC attributes enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport to "true" for each VPC. Create an Amazon Route 53 private zone for each VPC. Create resource record sets for the domain and subdomains. Programmatically associate the hosted zones in each VPC with the other VPCs.  
**C.** Create a shared services VPC in a central account. Create a VPC peering connection from the VPCs in other accounts to the shared services VPC. Create an Amazon Route 53 privately hosted zone in the shared services VPC with resource record sets for the domain and subdomains. Allow UDP and TCP port 53 over the VPC peering connections.  
**D.** Set the VPC attributes enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport to "false" in every VPC. Create an AWS Direct Connect connection with a private virtual interface. Allow UDP and TCP port 53 over the virtual interface. Use the on-premises DNS servers to resolve the IP addresses in each VPC on AWS.

A business has hired a Solutions Architect to create a secure content management system that can be accessed through API calls from external customer apps.  
The organization demands that a client administrator be able to make API calls and, if necessary, roll back modifications to existing files provided to the content management system.  

Which deployment strategy is the MOST SECURE and satisfies all solution requirements?  

>**A.** Use Amazon S3 for object storage with versioning and bucket access logging enabled, and an IAM role and access policy for each customer application. Encrypt objects using SSE-KMS. Develop the content management application to use a separate AWS KMS key for each customer.  
**B.** Use Amazon WorkDocs for object storage. Leverage WorkDocs encryption, user access management, and version control. Use AWS CloudTrail to log all SDK actions and create reports of hourly access by using the Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. Enable a revert function in the SDK based on a static Amazon S3 webpage that shows the output of the CloudWatch dashboard.  
**C.** Use Amazon EFS for object storage, using encryption at rest for the Amazon EFS volume and a customer managed key stored in AWS KMS. Use IAM roles and Amazon EFS access policies to specify separate encryption keys for each customer application. Deploy the content management application to store all new versions as new files in Amazon EFS and use a control API to revert a specific file to a previous version.  
**D.** Use Amazon S3 for object storage with versioning and enable S3 bucket access logging. Use an IAM role and access policy for each customer application. Encrypt objects using client-side encryption, and distribute an encryption key to all customers when accessing the content management application.

A corporation has launched a new version of its website with an Asian and South American audience in mind. The website's media assets are stored on Amazon S3 and distributed through Amazon CloudFront to enhance end-user performance. However, customers are having a difficult time logging in since the authentication service is only accessible in the AWS Region us-east-1.  

How can the Solutions Architect enhance the login experience while maintaining a high level of security and performance with little administration effort?  

>**A.** Replicate the setup in each new geography and use Amazon Route 53 geo-based routing to route traffic to the AWS Region closest to the users.  
**B.** Use an Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution. Use CloudFront cached HTTP methods to improve the user login experience.  
**C.** Use Amazon Lambda@Edge attached to the CloudFront viewer request trigger to authenticate and authorize users by maintaining a secure cookie token with a session expiry to improve the user experience in multiple geographies.  
**D.** Replicate the setup in each geography and use Network Load Balancers to route traffic to the authentication service running in the closest region to users.

A business employs a three-tiered architecture with two Availability Zones. Users say that the website is down during the company's off season. The Solutions Architect determines that there have been no recent modifications to the environment, that the website is accessible, and that logging in is feasible. When the Solutions Architect chooses the 'find a shop near you' feature, the maps offered on the site through a third-party RESTful API request fail to operate around 50% of the time after refreshing the page. Outbound API calls are routed using Amazon EC2 Network Address Translation (NAT) instances.  

Which of the following is the MOST LIKELY cause of this failure, and how may it be avoided in the future?  

>**A.** The network ACL for one subnet is blocking outbound web traffic. Open the network ACL and prevent administration from making future changes through IAM.  
**B.** The fault is in the third-party environment. Contact the third party that provides the maps and request a fix that will provide better uptime.  
**C.** One NAT instance has become overloaded. Replace both EC2 NAT instances with a larger-sized instance and make sure to account for growth when making the new instance size.  
**D.** One of the NAT instances failed. Recommend replacing the EC2 NAT instances with a NAT gateway.

A business is moving to the cloud. It want to analyze the virtual machine settings in its current data center infrastructure in order to verify that it can appropriately size new Amazon EC2 instances. The business need metrics like as CPU, memory, and disk use, as well as an inventory of the processes executing on each instance. Additionally, the organization want to monitor network connections in order to map conversations between servers.  

Which would permit the most cost-effective acquisition of this data?  

>**A.** Use AWS Application Discovery Service and deploy the data collection agent to each virtual machine in the data center.  
**B.** Configure the Amazon CloudWatch agent on all servers within the local environment and publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.  
**C.** Use AWS Application Discovery Service and enable agentless discovery in the existing virtualization environment.  
**D.** Enable AWS Application Discovery Service in the AWS Management Console and configure the corporate firewall to allow scans over a VPN.
