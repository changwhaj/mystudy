A web firm want to integrate an external payment service into their highly accessible application that is installed on a virtual private cloud (VPC). Their EC2 instances for their application are hidden behind a public-facing ELB. Under typical load conditions, auto scaling is employed to deploy new instances. The application runs two instances in the Auto Scaling group, but may scale up to three times its size at its maximum. The application instances must interact with the payment service through the Internet, which necessitates whitelisting any public IP addresses needed to connect to the payment service. At any one moment, a maximum of four whitelisting IP addresses may be added using an API.  

What approach should they use while architecting their solution?  

>**A.** Route payment requests through two NAT instances setup for High Availability and whitelist the Elastic IP addresses attached to the MAT instances.  
**B.** Whitelist the VPC Internet Gateway Public IP and route payment requests through the Internet Gateway.

Your business maintains a social media website for document storage and sharing. The online application enables users to upload big files while stopping and restarting the upload process as necessary. At the moment, files are uploaded to your PHP front end using Elastic Load Balancing and an autoscaling fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances that scale based on the average amount of data received (NetworkIn). Following the upload of a file, it is transferred to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).  

Amazon EC2 instances are enabled for Amazon S3 uploads using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. Your user base and  

scale have risen dramatically, prompting you to adjust the Max parameter for the Auto Scaling group many times. Your CFO is worried about growing expenses and has taken measures to mitigate them.  

requested that you make necessary adjustments to the architecture in order to minimize expenses.  

Which architectural changes might you make to minimize expenses while maintaining the security and scalability of your online application?  

>**A.** Replace the Auto Scaling launch configuration to include c3.8xlarge instances; those instances can potentially yield a network throuthput of 10gbps.  
**B.** Re-architect your ingest pattern, have the app authenticate against your identity provider, and use your identity provider as a broker fetching temporary AWS credentials from AWS Secure Token Service (GetFederationToken). Securely pass the credentials and S3 endpoint/prefix to your app. Implement client-side logic to directly upload the file to Amazon S3 using the given credentials and S3 prefix.  
**C.** Re-architect your ingest pattern, and move your web application instances into a VPC public subnet. Attach a public IP address for each EC2 instance (using the Auto Scaling launch configuration settings). Use Amazon Route 53 Round Robin records set and HTTP health check to DNS load balance the app requests; this approach will significantly reduce the cost by bypassing Elastic Load Balancing.

Every hour, a corporation runs a batch analysis on their primary transactional database, which is running on an RDS MySQL server, in order to feed their central Data Warehouse, which is running on Redshift. Their batch apps are quite sluggish to execute. They must then update the top management dashboard with the new data once the batch is complete. The dashboard is generated by another on-premises system that is now initiated in response to a manually received email indicating that an update is necessary. Because the on-premises system is handled by another team, it cannot be updated.  

How would you improve this situation to address performance concerns while automating as much of the process as possible?

A 3-Ber e-commerce web application is now installed on-premises and will be transferred to AWS in order to increase scalability and flexibility. The web layer presently uses a network distributed file system to transfer read-only data. The app server layer makes use of an IP multicast-based clustering technique for discovery and shared session information. The database layer scales by using shared-storage clustering and many read slaves. Weekly off-site tape backups of all servers and the distributed file system directory are performed.  

Which AWS storage and database architecture best satisfies the application's requirements?  

>**A.** Web servers: store read-only data in S3, and copy from S3 to root volume at boot time. App servers: share state using a combination of DynamoDB and IP unicast. Database: use RDS with multi-AZ deployment and one or more read replicas. Backup: web servers, app servers, and database backed up weekly to Glacier using snapshots.

To track the call activity of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, you require a permanent and durable storage. The average length of a call is 2-3 minutes. Each tracked call may be active or inactive. Each minute, an external application must be informed of the list of presently active calls. Normally, there are a few calls each second, but once a month, there is a brief period of up to 1000 calls per second. Because the system is available 24 hours a day, any downtime should be avoided. Periodically, historical data is preserved to files. This project places a premium on cost savings.  

Which database solution would be the most cost-effective in this scenario?  

>**A.** Use DynamoDB with a "Calls" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "State" attribute that can equal to "active" or "terminated". In this way the Global Secondary Index can be used for all items in the table.  
**B.** Use RDS Multi-AZ with a "CALLS" table and an indexed "STATE" field that can be equal to "ACTIVE" or 'TERMINATED". In this way the SQL query is optimized by the use of the Index.  
**C.** Use RDS Multi-AZ with two tables, one for "ACTIVE_CALLS" and one for "TERMINATED_CALLS". In this way the "ACTIVE_CALLS" table is always small and effective to access.  
**D.** Use DynamoDB with a "Calls" table and a Global Secondary Index on a "IsActive" attribute that is present for active calls only. In this way the Global Secondary Index is sparse and more effective.

Currently, a three-tier e-commerce web application is installed on-premises and will be transferred to AWS for increased scalability and flexibility. At the moment, the web server uses a network distributed file system to transfer read-only data. The application server layer makes use of an IP multicast-based clustering technique for discovery and shared session state. The database layer scales by using shared-storage clustering and many read slaves. Weekly off-site tape backups are performed on all servers and the distributed file system directory.  

Which AWS storage and database architecture best fulfills your application's requirements?  

>**A.** Web servers: store read-only data in S3, and copy from S3 to root volume at boot time. App servers: share state using a combination of DynamoDB and IP unicast.

When the instance was launched, the organization established two distinct network interfaces (main + ENI) and desired two elastic IP addresses for the instance. It was advised to utilize a public IP from AWS rather than an elastic IP due to the limited amount of elastic IPs.  

Which course of action would you suggest to the organization?  

>**A.** I agree with the suggestion but will prefer that the organization should use separate subnets with each ENI for different public IPs.  
**B.** I do not agree as it is required to have only an elastic IP since an instance has more than one ENI and AWS does not assign a public IP to an instance with multiple ENIs.  
**C.** I do not agree as AWS VPC does not attach a public IP to an ENI; so the user has to use only an elastic IP only.
